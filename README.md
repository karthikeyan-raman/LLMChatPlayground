## Implementing LLM API Integration

This version includes a mock implementation for simulating LLM responses. To connect to real LLM APIs:

1. Obtain API keys for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, etc.)
2. Update the `chatService.ts` file to make actual API calls
3. Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
4. Add appropriate authentication and security measures
